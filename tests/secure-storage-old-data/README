Resources for testing secure-storage data migration to key-manager.

How to use:
1) [Host]   Push resources to target by running script:
            # sh ./push-data.sh
2) [Target] Move from secure-storage directory to key-manager data directory
            by running upgrade script in target:
            # sh /etc/opt/upgrade/233.key-manager-move-ss-migratable-data.patch.sh
3) [Target] Restart key-manager service and run any operation which unlocks system db

Description:
secure-storage module is removed since Tizen platform version 3.0.
secure-storage data is migrated like the form below.
Exception: ""optional password used data cannot be migrated.""

Key factors of secure-storage data are <data name> and <storage name>
<storage name> is group id if given else smack label of client.

examples) Client with...
Case1:: <smack label> = "client.service.label", <data name> = "data", <group id> = "secure-storage::client"
-> key factors: <data name> = "data", <storage name> = "client"
Case2:: <smack label> = "client.service.label", <data name> = "data", <group id> = null
-> key factors: <data name> = "data", <storage name> = "client.service.label"

Secure-storage data with <data name> and <storage name> will be migrated to key-manager system db
with name = "<storage name>-<data name>"

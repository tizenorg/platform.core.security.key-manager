Resources for testing secure-storage data migration to key-manager.

Secure storage data is migrated to system db and admin user db.
Data migrated to admin user db also because there's some services which was system service
but user service from 3.0. (e.g., email-service). They should handle migrated data from newly
added data differently because user service cannot save data to system db.

How to use:
1) [Host]   Push resources to target by running script:
            # sh ./push-data.sh
2) [Target] Move from secure-storage directory to key-manager data directory
            by running upgrade script in target:
            # sh /etc/opt/upgrade/233.key-manager-move-ss-migratable-data.patch.sh
3) [Target] Restart key-manager service

Description:
secure-storage module is removed since Tizen platform version 3.0.
secure-storage data is migrated like the form below.
Exception: ""optional password used data cannot be migrated.""

Key factors of secure-storage data are <data name> and <storage name>
<storage name> is group id if given else smack label of client.
Data has been grouped by <storage name> in secure-storage but no more grouping in key-manager.
All data is saved in both of
1) system db              with "/System" owner which is smack label(=owner name) of system services
2) admin user db("owner") with "/User" owner which is smack label(=owner name) of user services.

<storage name> is only used for migratable data re-encryption.

system db with owner label = "/System" and name = "<data name>"
admin user(owner) db with owner label = "/User" and name = "<data name>"

storage name extraction examples) Client with...
Case1:: <smack label> = "client.service.label", <data name> = "data", <group id> = "secure-storage::client"
-> key factors: <data name> = "data", <storage name> = "client"
Case2:: <smack label> = "client.service.label", <data name> = "data", <group id> = null
-> key factors: <data name> = "data", <storage name> = "client.service.label"
